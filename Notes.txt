Set 2, Challenge 16    CBC bit-flipping

An oracle takes an input string and encrypts it under AES CBC and returns the encrypted bytes. It also takes encrypted bytes and returns the decrypted string. The oracle strips out ';' and '=' characters from user input. However, by adjusting the encrypted bytes passed to the oracle, a malicious ";admin=true" string can still be input to the oracle. (This assumes the oracle would actually allow the encrypted bytes that were input to change the state of the oracle.)
